Extract valuable info out of Twitter for marketing, finance, academic or professional research and much more.

This course harnesses the upside of R and Tableau to do sentiment analysis on Twitter data. With sentiment analysis you find out if the crowd has a rather positive or negative opinion towards a given search term. This search term can be a product (like in the course) but it can also be a person, region, company or basically anything as long as it is mentioned regularly on Twitter.

While R can directly fetch the text data from Twitter, clean and analyze it, Tableau is great at visualizing the data. And that is the power of the method outlined in this course. You get the best of both worlds, a dream team.
